# lame_rover
Another RC car with a camera built with raspberry pi

This was a rover build for the purpose of a group project in computer networks, this part here is the one which should be running on the raspberry pi connected to a LAN.
The camera feed is provided via HTTPS and the control is on PORT 22 i.e. SSH.

The other part of this i.e. the remote if you'd like to control it via a GUI instead of termial is here: https://github.com/CrypticVader/lame_remote

Here's a picture of the project:
